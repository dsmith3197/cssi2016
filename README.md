This is the work I completed at Google's 2016 Computer Science Summer Institute in Chicago.  The program is a 3 week intensive computer science bootcamp, helping rising college freshmen get a head start in the field.  The program culminates in a week long group project, developing a webapp utilizing html, css, javascript, python, and  Google's appEngine.
